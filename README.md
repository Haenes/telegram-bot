# telegram-bot
[Telegram bot](https://t.me/bugs_tracker_bot) for Ð° [BugTracker](https://github.com/Haenes/bugtracker) that works through the BugTracker API.

<b>Through it you can:</b>
1) View a list of your already created projects and issues, with pagination;
2) Edit/delete existing projects and issues;
3) Create new projects and issues;
4) Customize the displayed information for yourself by changing the language and/or time zone.

<b>Future plans:</b>
1) Add an [aiogram-dialog](https://github.com/Tishka17/aiogram_dialog) to view, create, edit projects and issues + settings;
2) Transfer the API to the asynchronous framework and make asynchronous requests to it (not via requests).
Yes, I know that now this is an asynchronous bot that makes requests through a synchronous library to a synchronous API...
3) Change pooling to webhook.
